deprecations:
  - |
    We are saying goodbye to the legacy ``retworkx`` package that operates as a
    backwards compatibility alias for ``rustworkx``. It was originally marked as
    deprecated and is now being removed. The ``rustworkx`` name has now existed
    longer than the ``retworkx`` name and the ``retworkx`` package is no longer needed.
    We encourage users to migrate to the new name. Thanks for all users that have
    used ``retworkx`` since the early days of the project!
